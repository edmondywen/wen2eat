# wen2eat

Fall 2021 CS 35L Final Project by Cameron Fiske, Ray Hsiao, Eric Ma, Edmond Wen, Jess Xu

Our app mitigates risk of household food waste by maintaining a list of a userâ€™s ingredients and their expiration dates. Based on that information, the app will customize a list of recommended recipes for the user.

## Features

### Display dynamic data
Our **website shows a list of ingredients** that the user has on hand **and their respective expiration dates**. The **user can modify this list**, which will update both the database and the frontend.

### Upload persistant data to backend
When a **user modifies their list of on-hand ingredients, that information is updated in our database**. This information will also be **associated with a specific user**.

### Search through data
**Allow users to input dietary restrictions to filter recipe recommendations.**

### Unique Features
1. Users can log in to keep track of their pantry.
2. Compares recipes to available ingredients to find ideal recipe ideas for food that is on hand. Results will be filtered based on dietary restrictions.
3. Users can select favorite recipes that they can view at any time.
