# Database 

Current functionality: 
- Add an item to the database (since the skeleton site doesn't have a text box field, there's just a button to enter the same item, bread w/ expiration date of 10 days, into the database)
- Read the entire database (a button to print the entire database into the console)
- Database entries currently have two fields, ingredient name and days til expiration (currently somewhat misnamed as "expirationdate")

Todos (not exhaustive): 
- [ ] Find a way to update database items (this is needed to update "days til expiration")
- [ ] Add a timestamp field into database entries so we can update expiration dates accordingly. 
- [ ] Find a way to do math with above timestamps so we can update them at the right times. 
- [ ] Allow user to delete ingredient (this depends on some frontend functionality and is relatively simple on the backend.)
- [ ] Following from above, would have to link ingredient cards with document IDs
- [ ] Add group members to Firebase project
